		<p>Llamas are creatures that live on Earth; scientific name: Lama Glama. 
		They are white and furry, and they do look a tad odd, if I would say. 
		They are mainly used by humans to carry heavy goods from point A to B or C to D or, yeah you get the point. 
		This creature is a relative of the camel, although it does not have a hump. 
		These animals are known to attack their owners until their burdens are lessened. 
		Forms of attack: spitting, kicking, hissing. 
		Like cows, llamas can regurgitate and chew on the cud of food. Also, llamas do much more than carry stuff! 
		Leather is made from them, their poop is burned for fuel, and people also eat their meat!

		<p>Llamas are in the Camelidae family, and the class Mammalia. 
			Some close relatives are the alpaca, vicuna, and guanaco. 
			Unlike vicunas and guanacos, llamas live as domesticated animals. 
			Vicunas and guanacos live in the wild, however. 
			Interestingly enough, the Camelidae family are in the same order as pigs; the order is Artiodactyla.

		<p>
			A full grown llama is about 5.5 to 6 feet tall, and weighs from 280 lbs to 450 lbs. 
			A baby llama, a cria, weighs between 20 and 30 lbs. Normally, a llamaâ€™s lifespan is 15-20 years. 
			Llamas are very intelligent. 
			They can learn skills in just a couple of tries, like getting in and out of a car. 
			Also, llamas are very social animals. They live in herds. 
			These Camelids communicate by ear position, body language, spitting, and humming. 
			Llamas only usually spit as a form of self defense, or to discipline other llamas.
