		<p><strong>The Planetitos!</strong></p>
		<p class="sub">Posted December 3, 2018</p>
		<p class="main-p"> I finally made another producer! Organisms would have a fairly hard time eating it, though.<br></p>
		<p class="main-p"><strong>The Living Moons<br></strong></p>
		<p class="main-p"> These colassal creatures would be the same size as a small moon (Remind you of anything? Hint: That's no moon...), and would have an outer membrane of cellulose (or other polymer). They would use hydrogen captured from the atmosphere to float. Because of the size, and also because of the amount of nutrients in this creature, very few would exist. They would sythesise glucose or another source of energy from the surrounding nutrients. If a predator destroyed
			part of this organism, the long process to regrow it would begin. Because of their size, these creatures would have a very slow reproduction process. If too many predators lived on Neptune, this species would become extinct due to the small number of nutrients in the Neptunian atmosphere and large number of predators...  </p>

		<p><strong>The Luminous Bubbles!</strong></p>
		<p class="sub">Posted December 3, 2018</p>
		<p class="main-p">Okay, so I know I promised I'd make another producer, but then I realized it would be much easier to make a scavenger. (Also, "Bubbles of the Dead" sounds much cooler than "Bubbles of sythesising food from inorganic chemicals"!) So, here it is:<br></p>
		<p class="main-p"><strong>The Bubbles of the Dead<br></strong></p>
		<p class="main-p">These bubble shaped organism's cellulose (or other polymer) would be inforced with steel, allowing them to go into the upper reaches of the mantle, as well as the upper reaches of the atmosphere. The dead bodies of organisms would be collected, and the nutriets could then be consumed.
		Collected glucose (or other energy source) would be burned and turned into heat, which due to the organism's inner steel, would create a good heat source as well as a light. Like Floating Pigs, these creatures would move by floating on the wind and adjusting course as needed by creating an opening in the membrane and expelling gasses out of it.
		Also, these scavengers would have eye-like holes that could see the same wavelengths we do, so they can see a dead organism's body. They would probably consume the bodies of Mini Rays, Floating Pigs, and some other creatures I have not talked about yet.</p>

		<p><strong>When Pigs Float</strong></p>
		<p class="sub">Posted December 2, 2018</p>
		<p class="main-p">Behold: An example Producer-vore (I can't call them herbivores because there are no plants on Neptune!)<br></p>
		<p class="main-p"><strong>The Floating Pigs!<br></strong></p>
		<p class="main-p">These multicellular beings would be "fluffly". What I mean is that the creature's density would be less than that of Neptune's mantle, causing the heterotroph to float just above an icy hell. (Note: if any organism went into Neptune's mantle, it would be simltaneously crushed, fried, pierced, and frozen.)
		They would have a oval-shaped central body, with about eight appendeges sticking out of the bottom. They would look like stubs of limbs, but because there is no surface on Neptune, they would be not be used for walking, but for floating! 
		Normally, the organisams would float on Neptunes winds, but when needing to correct their course to get away from danger, they could blow gasses out of holes in the ends of thier appendages, causing them to steer away from danger. They would "see" in infared, because all creatures, the eaten or the eaters, would have to give off infared waves. 
		These creatures would have a mouth, in which they would capture eyeless Mini Rays in for consumption. Again, energy (maybe in the form of glucose) would go towards heating the organism. If these creatures were to live in herds, an evolutionary aspect gained over time might be to controll the infared waves coming out of the body. This could be used as a basic form of communication or for hiding. They might also eat other organisms...</p>

		<p><strong>Producers On Neptune</strong></p>
		<p class="sub">Posted December 1, 2018</p>
		<p class="main-p">Sorry for not posting in a while! I've been quite busy thinking of ideas for posts next week.<br></p>
		<p class="main-p">This week, I will be posting ideas for extraterrestrial life on Neptune! My idea came from Carl Sagan's Cosmos, which I suggest everyone should read! The first step in making a
		theory for life on Neptune is making a producer. Here is a possible autotroph in the ecosystem of Neptune:<br></p>
		<p class="main-p"><strong>The Mini Rays</strong></p>
		<p class="main-p">These microbes would "drift" on the high speed winds. Their aerodynamic shape would slightly resemble manta rays. They would live just above the mantle, where organic compounds are 
		common, but the tempature is not too hot. They would sythesize glucose (or other source of energy) from a mixture of organic and inorganic molecules found in the atmosphere, like terrestrial lithotrophs. They would be capable of mitosis, which most of the gathered energy would go towards. Energy would also go towards heating the creature in the cold airscape of Neptune. I imagine them being camoflauged wiith blue and white and living in herds to protect themselves from the next step in the food chain...
