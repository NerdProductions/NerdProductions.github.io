		<p><strong>When Pigs Float</strong></p>
		<p class="sub">Posted December 2, 2018</p>
		<p class="main-p">Behold: An example Producer-vore (I can't call them herbivores because there are no plants on Neptune!)<br></p>
		<p class="main-p"><strong>The Floating Pigs!<br></strong></p>
		<p class="main-p">These multicellular beings would be "fluffly". What I mean by that is that the creature's density would be less than that of Neptune's mantle, causing the heterotroph to float just above an icy hell. (Note: if any organism went into Neptune's mantle, it would be simltaneously crushed, fried, pierced, and frozen.)
		They would have a oval-shaped central body, with about eight appendeges sticking out of the bottom. They would look like stubs of limbs, but because there is no surface on Neptune, they would be not be used for walking, but for floating! 
		Normally, the organisams would float on Neptunes winds, but when needing to correct their course to get away from danger, they could blow gasses out of holes in the ends of thier appendages, causing them to steer awy from danger. They would "see" in infared, because all creatures, the eaten or the eaters, would have to give off infared waves. 
		These creatures would have a mouth, in which they would capture eyeless Mini Rays in for consumption. Again, energy would go towards heating the organism. If these creatures were to live in herds, an evolutionary aspect gained over time might be to controll the infared waves coming out of the body. This could be used as a basic form of communication or for hiding. They might also eat other organisms...</p>

		<p><strong>Producers On Neptune</strong></p>
		<p class="sub">Posted December 1, 2018</p>
		<p class="main-p">Sorry for not posting in a while! I've been quite busy thinking of ideas for posts next week.<br></p>
		<p class="main-p">This week, I will be posting ideas for extraterrestrial life on Neptune! My idea came from Carl Sagan's Cosmos, which I suggest everyone should read! The first step in making a
		theory for life on Neptune is making a producer. Here is a possible autotroph in the ecosystem of Neptune:<br></p>
		<p class="main-p"><strong>The Mini Rays</strong></p>
		<p class="main-p">These microbes would "drift" on the high speed winds. Their aerodynamic shape would slightly resemble manta rays. They would live just above the mantle, where organic compounds are 
		common, but the tempature is not too hot. They would sythesize food from a mixture of organic and inorganic molecules found in the atmosphere, like terrestrial lithotrophs. They would be capable of mitosis, which most of the gathered energy would go towards. Energy would also go towards heating the creature in the cold airscape of Neptune. I imagine them being camoflauged wiith blue and white and living in herds to protect themselves from the next step in the food chain...
