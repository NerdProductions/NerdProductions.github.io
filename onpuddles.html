            <p>This is the first article on Potato Press, and I will be talking about one of the greatest mysteries of the world: puddles. Why do they seem to act like black holes for sports equipment?  Is it possible for a mini ecosystem to evolve in a puddle? Is there a direct way for figuring out just how long that puddle in front of your house is going to last? These questions and more may or may not be answered, and if so may not be correct.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p class="postsubheader">Sports Equipment</p>
            <p><br/>Have you ever been playing basketball outside, a few hours after it rained, and you accidentally drop the ball? Being round, the basketball begins rolling. And it keeps rollings, splashing right into the <span class="emphasis">one</span> puddle that hadn't evaporated yet, getting you and your poor basketball wet. What are the chances!</p>
            <p><br/>Pretty high, as it turns out. You see, the reason has to do with the formation of puddles in the first place. As rain falls, puddles gradually fill up, the first being in the deepest nooks and crannies, because gravity is pushing raindrops down, and the raindrops only come to rest when they reach the lowest point the can reach. The puddles in the deepest places are the last to evaporate, because they are the most massive. Gravity doesn't just act on raindrops, though, which causes your basketball to try to fill up the deepest nooks and crannies as well. Therefore, your basketball also goes to the lowest point, where the raindrop already took up residency, so it splashes the poor raindrop in your face.  </p>
            
            <p><br/> This doesn't just apply to basketballs, though. Anything you clumsily drop, including tennis balls, footballs, or even kickballs will probably go splash. <br/> Note: Tennis rackets probably won't roll down into the puddle, but being a man of science and having not tried it before, I cannot say with good certainty.</p>
            <br/>
            <p class="postsubheader">The Math of Puddles</p><p> <br/>I found the below evaporation equation on a website about pools, as I guess it's most relevant to pool people, but it's also relevant to us who care about puddles.<br/> <br/> E = [ 7.4PA(0.447W)^.78]/(T + 459.67)<br/><br/>When E = rate of evaporation (gallons/day), P = water vapor pressure in mmHG (This can be found using an online table.), A = surface area, W = wind speed above water, and T = temperature. </p>
            
            <p><br/> So say there's a rather large puddle right outside your house, with a diameter of 2 feet (And surface area of 6.28... square feet).  Just how long would it take to evaporate?
            <br/>
            <br/>
            The first step would be, obviously, to figure out the other variables, mainly by determining where you live. If you lived in San Francisco, where it is pretty reliably 60 degrees year-round, you could input that temperature on an online table to get the water vapor pressure. I got 13.24, rounded up to the nearest hundredth. If, say, it's windy in San Francisco and the wind speed is 15 miles per hour, then you can compute the equation itself.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            The denominator would be equal to 519.67, and the numerator 2714.37, with a grand total of evaporated 5.22 gallons per day. Both gallons and days are larger than you need for a simple puddle, so by changing around a few units I got 1.74 pint per hour.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>If your puddle was an inch thick, then it would have a volume of 75.36 cubic inches, or about 2.609 pints, and would take a little over an hour to evaporate.</p>
            <p><br/> If you are still interested in puddles and math after reading this, then here's a fun math game to try when you are bored in math class. First, draw an uneven puddle shape; the more blocky, the easier, especially if you are using graph paper. Split it into some uneven sections, then try to calculate the probability that a point chosen randomly somewhere inside the puddle is in a given section. This can occupy you for quite a while, but only if you actually like math in the first place.</p>
            <br/>
            <p class="postsubheader">The Ecosystems of the Relatively Small</p>
            <p><br/>Onto the final question about puddles, a question that takes to the very meaning of life itself: Would it be possible for an ecosystem to exist at such scales?
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Let's see. The three major components of an ecosystem are producers, things that eat the producers, and decomposers, but the most important part is the producer. Without it, the entire energy cycle of the ecosystem would be broken. So with that in mind, can we find a producer? In fact, we can, easily. One of the possible producers could be a type of microorganism that has existed in water and plagued pool-people since the dawn of time: algae. Green algae is a tiny freshwater species, and it is perfect for the beginning of a little puddle ecosystem.
            <br/>
            <br/> Before I finish, I'd like to introduce an alternate scenario: acid rain. What species could live in a pond with high levels of acidity? There is a particular type of producers that could do this, known as the extremophiles. This high-class batch of microbes can survive and even thrive in extreme conditions, including extreme temperatures, high salinity, and even high acidity. Thillobacillus is an acid resistant producer, perfect for an acidic puddle.
